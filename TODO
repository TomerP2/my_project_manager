Future features?:
  ☐ Add option to 'add to project' which adds modules to project
  ☐ Add option to add modules to specific places inside project
  ☐ Maybe split core templates and module templates? -> Core templates are placed once. Module templates are placed inside core templates.
  ☐ Add option to have simple script that is executed with template. Not copied over. Could be bash / python. Lets user customize project creation more.
  ☐ Allow user to sync project with the template folder, so that changes to the template are reflected in the projects.
  ☐ Allow user to zip projects for sharing. Which automatically removes the .env and creates a .env.example file.
  ☐ Replace text 'AUTHOR', 'EMAIL', and others with input text.
  ☐ Add launch.json to ttd template.
  ☐ Add option to create virtual environment when creating project.

Backlog:
  ☐ In settings menu, have folder browser instead of tet input for folders.
  ☐ In settings menu, change \ to / automatically.
  ☐ Test copying symlink folders 
  ☐ Create a virtual enviroment for this project.
  ☐ Write a tutorial for using project templates.
  
To do:
  ☐ @bug In template GIS process, the placeholder name in the .jpyter file is replaced which causes errors. 
  ☐ @bug Settings.json isn't being created on new machine.
