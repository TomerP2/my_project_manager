I am using python and tkinter for a small python tool. I want to create a class that uses tkinter to make a simple GUI for different parts of the application. The class should look something like this:

class simpleActionWindow():
    # Class that  takes in user inputs and activates a given function with the user inputs
    def __init__(self):
        ...
    
    def add_folder_input(text, input_name):
        # Lets user select a folder
    
    def add_list_input(text, input_name, list):
        # Lets user select from a list

    def add_boolean_input(text, input_name):
        # Lets user toggle a switch

    def go_button(text, function_to_activate):
        # activates the function with the user inputs

    def run_window()

I have some questions:
1. Is this best practice? 
2. If not, what is the better way to approach having a standardized GUI for my application (aka to reduce duplicate code across different GUI scripts.)
