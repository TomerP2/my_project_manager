I want to rewrite create_project to be more modular. The function should still take in project_path and use_git, but template_dir should become a list of paths and be renamed template_dirs. Each path given in template_dirs will be to a template folder. Each template folder should be copied into the project_path folder. Then the renaming should stay the same. use_git should also remain the same. The obsidan vault creation can be removed.
- Use python best practice.
- Replace as little code as possible.
- Keep the code concise and clear
